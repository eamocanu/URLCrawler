Simple URL checker created using MVC architecture. 
Parses a webpage for dead links. It does not follow the links to other pages and so on. It checks only the page entered.

A link is considered dead, if this app doesn't get a reply for some specified time. Right now the timeout time is very small so many slow links will be considered dead.
